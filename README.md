# SoftwareForAnalysingData

This repository includes three reports written in the programming language R.
1. report: The goal was to create a short report explaining a statistical term with the potential goal of contributing to an existing wikipedia made to teach students basic knowledge of statistics. I decided to contribute to an entry about "residuals".
2. report: This report was part of a 48-hour data analysis challenge. The data was randomly assigned to us with the aim to analyse it the given time-frame.
3. report: The goal of this report was to analyse a dataset of our choice. As I am interested in medicine, I chose to analyse data about cardiovascular disease.
